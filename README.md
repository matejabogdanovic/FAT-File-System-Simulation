# FAT-File-System-Simulation
This is my FAT file system simulation. 
Entry - 1B. There are 2^8 blocks. Each block is 2^8*1B.
File harddisk.txt represents a disk. 
HDisk is a singleton class which has 2 methods: read and write from a given block.
Those are the only 2 operations which are possible to perform on a disk.
